//CONSOLE APPLICATION ASSIGNMENT Step 158
//In Visual Studio, create a console application that does the following:
//1.Takes an input from the user, multiplies it by 50, then prints the result to the console. (Note: make sure your code can take inputs larger than 10,000,000).
//2.Takes an input from the user, adds 25 to it, then prints the result to the console.
//3. Takes an input from the user, divides it by 12.5, then prints the result to the console.
//4. Takes an input from the user, checks if it is greater than 50, then prints the true/false result to the console.
//5. Takes an input from the user, divides it by 7, then prints the remainder to the console (tip: think % operator).
