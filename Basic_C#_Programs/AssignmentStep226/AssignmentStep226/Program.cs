//ASSIGNMENT (Step 226)
//Perform these actions and create a console app that includes the following:
//1.Create a class. In that class, create a method that will take in an integer, create a math operation for this integer (addition, subtraction, etc.), then return the answer as an integer.
//2.In the Main() method of the console app, instantiate the class and call the one method, passing in an integer. Display the result to the screen.
//3. Add a second method to the class with the same name that will take in a decimal, create a different math operation for it, then return the answer as an integer.
//4. In the Main() method of the console app, instantiate the class and call the second method, passing in a decimal. Display the result to the screen.
//5. Add a third method to the class, with the same name, that will take in a string, convert it to an integer if possible, do a different math operation to it, then return the answer as an integer.
//6. In the Main() method of the console app, instantiate the class and call the third method, passing in a string that equates to an integer. Display the result to the screen.
