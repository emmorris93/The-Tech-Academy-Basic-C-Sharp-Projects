//1.Create a class. In that class, create a method that takes two integers as parameters. Make one of them optional. Have the method do a math operation and return an integer result.
//2. In the Main() method of the console app, instantiate the class.
//3.Ask the user to input two numbers, one at a time. Let them know they need not enter anything for the second number.
//4. Call the method in the class, passing in the one or two numbers entered.
//5. Try various combinations of numbers on the code, including having no second number.
